			  <p>Discussion 4</p>

			  <p>Throughout history, there have always been problems with punishing criminals
				 and what should be done to criminals after someone has been convicted of a crime.
				 The punishment of a crime has changed over time, along with the civil rights of the
				 criminal.  The correction of criminals has always been an ongoing debate for centuries.
				 So, how are the prison systems in the past any different from the modern-day prison
				 system of today?
			  </p>	
			  <p>Before there was a criminal justice system of correctional institutions, prisons,
 			     reformatories, and rehabilitation institutions, there was little or no punishment
				 for criminals. Criminals get swift punishment with no civil rights for the criminal
				 offenders. If convicted, the sentences were cruel and quick punishment. If instituted
				 for incarceration, convicted offenders would spend long periods of time in jail. 
				 For a person, misdeeds were typically banishment, slavery, restitution, corporal punishment, 
				 and/or execution.  There was no history of any prison system till the twelfth century. 
				 At that time, King Henry II ordered the construction of county jails to hold vagrants 
				 and thieves before sentence. In the early 1300 in Florence, Italy was punishing offenders 
				 for criminal would be placed in jail cells. Offenders were separated into enclosed cells 
				 by classified gender, age, mental state, and seriousness of the crime.  Where in America, 
				 in the early seventeenth century, the modern American correctional system began under 
				 the leadership of William Penn.
			  </p> 	 
			  <p>There was some setback in the penal institution after William Penn's death. Penn revised 
			     the criminal code to forbid capricious use of mutilation and physical punishment, and 
				 torture. A more humane penalty of imprisonment was giving as hard labor, moderate flogging, 
				 finds, and forfeiture of property. They were doing away with widely public forms of 
				 punishment, like branding irons, stocks, pillories, and gallows. Still, in 1776 Benjamin Rush,
				 a Quaker from Pennsylvania, adopts Penn's penal code, along with formed the Philadelphia 
				 Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons.  Society would bring some orderly 
				 treatment to the growing penal system and some degree of humanity. The Quakers also factor 
				 in the economic potential of the prison industry.  Over the years, some reform efforts have 
				 been adopted into the prison system.  That correction experts believe with treatment, 
				 education, and training. Inmates would reform offended into model citizens. Today's 
				 prison system has changed to a more humane approach.
			  </p>
			  <p>Today, there are more correctional facilities that house dangerous felons and maintains 
			     strict security measures, like maximum and super-maximum-security prisons. The nonviolent 
				 offender is likely in a medium-security prison where it allows freedom of movement for 
				 rehabilitation workers and other therapeutic personnel. Then there is "club fed," with 
				 tennis courts and pools, known as minimum-security prisons for more are less white-collar 
				 criminals.
			  </p>
			  <p>Today, the correctional system not only has a maximum, medium, and minimum-security prisons, 
			     it also has alternative correctional institutions like prison farms, where prisoners work 
				 on farms that produce dairy products, grain, and vegetable crops. Another alternative is 
				 boot camps like correctional institutions. This concept is for a short period of stay, 
				 with high-intensity exercise that will "shock" the inmate into going straight.
